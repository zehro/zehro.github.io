                    Design is not just about making things look nice. It's a way
                    of thinking, a set of principles that can guide people. It's
                    a skill that takes time to master, and many argue about
                    what's best. For me, it's an art, a craft where I can show
                    others how to use things and understand anything. It's one
                    thing to express what I envision, but it's an entirely
                    different challenge to communicate what I have in my head to
                    everyone else. I don't think I'm an expert, but I'd like to
                    think that I'm good at it.

                    Coding is amazing, but I grew up with drawing. I wanted to
                    study Digital Illustration at the Savannah College of Art
                    and Design. However, since it had no HOPE (the scholarship,
                    ba-dum-tsh), Georgia Tech became my future and broadened my
                    horizon with programming, 3D modeling, animation, and more
                    than I ever thought of. Whenever videos are rendering or I'm
                    not dying from assignments/lack of sleep, I dabble in
                    creating random stuff.

                            I mostly do stuff on Photoshop and Illustrator. I
                            haven't been able to do much since my tablet was
                            stolen, but I still try to make content for VGDev
                            and for fun.

                            So... Blender has the learning curve of a thousand
                            suns, but I still try to learn it since it's free.
                            I have worked with Maya and other programs, but I
                            believe they're all amazing with enough practice.
