        Design is not just about making things look nice. It's a way
        of thinking, a set of principles that can guide people. It's
        a skill that takes time to master, and many argue about
        what's best. For me, it's an art, a craft where I can show
        others how to use things and understand anything. It's one
        thing to express what I envision, but it's an entirely
        different challenge to communicate what I have in my head to
        everyone else. I don't think I'm an expert, but I'd like to
        think that I'm good at it.

        Coding is amazing, but I grew up with drawing. I wanted to
        study Digital Illustration at the Savannah College of Art
        and Design. However, since it had no HOPE (the scholarship,
        ba-dum-tsh), Georgia Tech became my future and broadened my
        horizon with programming, 3D modeling, animation, and more
        than I ever thought of. Whenever videos are rendering or I'm
        not dying from assignments/lack of sleep, I dabble in
        creating random stuff.

                I mostly do stuff on Photoshop and Illustrator. I
                haven't been able to do much since my tablet was
                stolen, but I still try to make content for VGDev
                and for fun.

                So... Blender has the learning curve of a thousand
                suns, but I still try to learn it since it's free.
                I have worked with Maya and other programs, but I
                believe they're all amazing with enough practice.
